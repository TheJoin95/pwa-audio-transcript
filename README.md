# Transcriber

This is a simple Progressive Web Application made in vanilla JS to simple transcribe an audio file or a voice message from Whatsapp, Telegram or other chat application (android or ios).

## How it works?

It is using the Wit.ai speech API (it works only with italian language, coz I'm italian, but it is possible to make english, dutch, german etc) but it can use also (if you are a rich guy) google, aws, azure and ibm speech recognition.

The manifest is using a new feature called "Share Target". It is a proposal available in crhome > 74 and it can permit to share some file to a PWA.
